*Note: In order to execute the last part of the notebook (item 4), one has to save in the ``auxiliary_files`` folder the files containing the weights of the pre-trained GAN and VAE. Those files (``netG_epoch_99.pth`` and ``vae_epoch_25.pth``, respectively) can be found in the following repository: https://github.com/csinva/gan-vae-pretrained-pytorch. The ``dcgan.py`` and ``vae.py`` scripts were also obtained from this repository*.
